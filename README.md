# Hey, I'm Kevin! 💖

I'm a fullstack developer who's currently expanding my skillset with DevOps and UI/UX design. 

Right now, I'm building [the only tool that finds articulable GE courses](https://github.com/laurelin60/GE-Z-Frontend), [open-source tools @ UCI](https://github.com/icssc), and [tech for social good](https://github.com/ctc-uci). Check out some of my favorite work, like an [accessibility-focused large action model](https://github.com/laurelin60/Agentic) or an [online, interactive life calendar](https://github.com/KevinWu098/lifesquared).

In my spare time, you'll probably [find me at a hackathon](https://devpost.com/kevinwu098) or on the pickleball courts.

I'd love to chat, so shoot me a message on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinwu098/)!

<!-- I'm enthusiastic about building and contributing to innovative projects that blend functionality and an engaging user experience. Currently, I'm creating frontend and fullstack applications that touch new technologies while connecting with personal passions.

My most comfortable tech stack is React with any flavor of CSS (vanilla, Tailwind, SCSS/SASS), but I also work well with component libraries (MaterialUI, etc). Additionally, I have experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to build fullstack applications.
