I'm a fullstack developer who's currently expanding my skillset into DevOps. Right now, I'm building 📚 [articulation tools](https://github.com/laurelin60/GE-Z-Frontend) and 🐜 [open-source @ UCI](https://github.com/icssc).

Check out some of my favorite work:
- 🤖 [Agentic](https://github.com/laurelin60/Agentic), an accessibility-focused large action model
- 📆 [Life Squared](https://github.com/KevinWu098/lifesquared), an online, interactive life calendar
- 🦆 [Radioactive Duck Hunt](https://github.com/laurelin60/radioactive-duck-game-client), a game that helps you learn ASL by hunting radioactive ducks
- 🌲 [Laurelin60](https://github.com/laurelin60), the Github Org hosting projects I build with friends

In my free time, you'll probably [find me at a hackathon](https://devpost.com/kevinwu098) or on the pickleball courts.

I'd love to chat, so shoot me a message on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinwu098/)!

<!-- I'm enthusiastic about building and contributing to innovative projects that blend functionality and an engaging user experience. Currently, I'm creating frontend and fullstack applications that touch new technologies while connecting with personal passions.

My most comfortable tech stack is React with any flavor of CSS (vanilla, Tailwind, SCSS/SASS), but I also work well with component libraries (MaterialUI, etc). Additionally, I have experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to build fullstack applications.
