<!-- I'm enthusiastic about building and contributing to innovative projects that blend functionality and an engaging user experience. Currently, I'm creating frontend and fullstack applications that touch new technologies while connecting with personal passions.

My most comfortable tech stack is React with any flavor of CSS (vanilla, Tailwind, SCSS/SASS), but I also work well with component libraries (MaterialUI, etc). Additionally, I have experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to build fullstack applications.
